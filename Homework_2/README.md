### Homework 1 - Question 6
#### 6. Revisit your Shape Program from Homework 1.  Write this program again (with the same requirements as the original) in a different OO language than you used the first time. Consider anything from an OOAD perspective that you’ve learned or thought about that you should change in this version.  Include those changes in your code’s comments and your README file.

##### Solution :

The Shape program from Homework 1, with the same requirements as the original, was re-written, this time in Python. 
This necessitated no particular changes from an OOAD perspective, the same concepts of inheritance and overriding of methods has been followed, after which sorting is done and the shapes before and after sorting are displayed. 
We found that between the two (Java and Python), Python was easier to code and implement these particular OOAD concepts in, also it allowed for easier Exception handling and sorting.

The screenshot showing the output of the program is as follows:
